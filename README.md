# (WIP) LibGMOD - EmmyLua bindings for Garry's Mod

This is a vain attempt to get sane IDE completion working with Visual Studio
Code.

This still doesn't have any type information or object classes in it, but at
at least stops the Lua language sever complaining about undefined globals.

## Usage

The best I've found so far is to add it as a submodule in whatever codebase
you're working on. This isn't great, but gets the job done.

If you know better, send me an issue
