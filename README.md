# (WIP) LibGMOD - [LuaLS](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Annotations) bindings for Garry's Mod

This is an attempt to get IDE completion working with https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server for any editor that supports language servers

## Usage

If you have lua-language-server installed, you can clone this repo and add it to to the `Lua.workspace.library` list
You can find an example of doing that in neovim here https://cfc.gg/configs/lua_ls/glua.lua
