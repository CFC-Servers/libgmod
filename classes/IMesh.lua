--- Renderable mesh object, can be used to create models on the fly. The only way to create your own IMesh object is to call Mesh.  
--- ðŸ¦Ÿ **BUG**: [IMeshes only respond to one projected texture.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/2301)

--- Builds the mesh from a table mesh vertexes.
