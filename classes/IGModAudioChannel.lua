end

--- î®´ client
--- Computes the [DFT (discrete Fourier transform)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) of the sound channel.  
--- The size parameter specifies the number of consecutive audio samples to use as the input to the DFT and is restricted to a power of two. A [Hann window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hann_function) is applied to the input data.  
--- The computed DFT has the same number of frequency bins as the number of samples. Only half of this DFT is returned, since [the DFT magnitudes are symmetric for real input data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform#The_real-input_DFT). The magnitudes of the DFT (values from 0 to 1) are used to fill the output table, starting at index 1.  
--- **Visualization protip:** For a size N DFT, bin k (1-indexed) corresponds to a frequency of (k - 1) / N * sampleRate.  
--- **Visualization protip:** Sound energy is proportional to the square of the magnitudes. Adding magnitudes together makes no sense physically, but adding energies does.  
--- **Visualization protip:** The human ear works on a logarithmic amplitude scale. You can convert to [decibels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) by taking 20 * math.log10 of frequency magnitudes, or 10 * math.log10 of energy. The decibel values will range from -infinity to 0.

--- @param size number @The number of samples to use
--- @return number @The number of frequency bins that have been filled in the output table.
