function CLuaLocomotion:GetNextBot()
end

--- Gets the max height the bot can step up  
--- @return number @Current step height
function CLuaLocomotion:GetStepHeight()
end

--- Returns the current movement velocity as a vector  
--- @return Vector @Current velocity
function CLuaLocomotion:GetVelocity()
end

--- Returns whether this CLuaLocomotion can reach and/or traverse/move in given CNavArea.  
--- @param area CNavArea @The area to test
--- @return boolean @Whether this CLuaLocomotion can traverse given CNavArea.
function CLuaLocomotion:IsAreaTraversable(area)
end

--- Returns true if we're trying to move.  
--- @return boolean @Whether we're trying to move or not.
function CLuaLocomotion:IsAttemptingToMove()
end

--- Returns true of the locomotion engine is jumping or climbing  
--- @return boolean @Whether we're climbing or jumping or not
function CLuaLocomotion:IsClimbingOrJumping()
end

--- Returns whether the nextbot this locomotion is attached to is on ground or not.  
--- @return boolean @Whether the nextbot is on ground or not.
function CLuaLocomotion:IsOnGround()
end

--- Returns true if we're stuck  
--- @return boolean @Whether we're stuck or not
function CLuaLocomotion:IsStuck()
end

--- Returns whether or not the target in question is on a ladder or not.  
--- @return boolean @If the target is on a ladder or not.
function CLuaLocomotion:IsUsingLadder()
end

--- Makes the bot jump  
function CLuaLocomotion:Jump()
end

--- @param landingGoal Vector 
--- @param landingForward Vector 
function CLuaLocomotion:JumpAcrossGap(landingGoal, landingForward)
end

--- Sets the acceleration speed
