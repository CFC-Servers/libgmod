--- @class CLuaLocomotion
--- This class is essentially what controls a NextBot NPC. You can access it in a NextBot NPC by using **self.loco** variable.  
local CLuaLocomotion = {}
--- Sets the location we want to get to.  
--- Each call of Approach moves the NextBot 1 unit towards the specified goal. The size of this unit is determined by SetDesiredSpeed; the default is `0` (each call of Approach moves the NextBot 0).
