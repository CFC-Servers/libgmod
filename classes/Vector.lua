--- List of all possible functions to manipulate vectors.  
--- Created by Global.Vector.  
--- @field x number @The X component of the vector.
--- @field y number @The Y component of the vector.
--- @field z number @The Z component of the vector.
--- @class Vector
local Vector = {}
--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Adds the values of the argument vector to the original vector. This function is the same as vector1 + vector2 without creating a new vector object, skipping object construction and garbage collection.  
--- @param vector Vector @The vector to add.
function Vector:Add(vector)
end

--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Returns an angle representing the normal of the vector.  
--- @return Angle @The angle/direction of the vector.
function Vector:Angle()
end

--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Returns the angle of this vector (normalized), but instead of assuming that up is Global.Vector( 0, 0, 1 ) (Like Vector:Angle does) you can specify which direction is 'up' for the angle.  
--- @param up Vector @The up direction vector
--- @return Angle @The angle
function Vector:AngleEx(up)
end

--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Calculates the cross product of this vector and the passed one.  
--- The cross product of two vectors is a 3-dimensional vector with a direction perpendicular (at right angles) to both of them (according to the right-hand rule), and magnitude equal to the area of parallelogram they span. This is defined as the product of the magnitudes, the sine of the angle between them, and unit (normal) vector `n` defined by the right-hand rule:  
--- :**a** Ã— **b** = |**a**| |**b**| sin(Î¸) **nÌ‚**  
--- where **a** and **b** are vectors, and **nÌ‚** is a unit vector (magnitude of 1) perpendicular to both.  
--- @param otherVector Vector @Vector to calculate the cross product with.
--- @return Vector @The cross product of the two vectors.
function Vector:Cross(otherVector)
end

--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Returns the squared distance of 2 vectors, this is faster than Vector:Distance as calculating the square root is an expensive process.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: Squared distances should not be summed. If you need to sum distances, use Vector:Distance.  
--- When performing a distance check, ensure the distance being checked against is squared. See example code below.  
--- @param otherVec Vector @The vector to calculate the distance to.
--- @return number @Squared distance to the vector.
function Vector:DistToSqr(otherVec)
end

--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Returns the euclidean distance between the vector and the other vector.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function is more expensive than Vector:DistToSqr. However, please see the notes for Vector:DistToSqr before using it as squared distances are not the same as euclidean distances.  
--- @param otherVector Vector @The vector to get the distance to.
--- @return number @Distance between the vectors.
function Vector:Distance(otherVector)
end

--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Divide the vector by the given number, that means x, y and z are divided by that value. This will change the value of the original vector, see example 2 for division without changing the value.  
--- @param divisor number @The value to divide the vector with.
function Vector:Div(divisor)
end

--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Returns the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Geometric_definition)  of this vector and the passed one.

--- **a Â· b** = |**a**| |**b**| cos(Î¸)   
--- where **a** and **b** are vectors.  
--- See Vector:Length for obtaining magnitudes.  
--- A dot product returns just the cosine of the angle if both vectors are normalized, and zero if the vectors are at right angles to each other.  
--- @param otherVector Vector @The vector to calculate the dot product with
--- @return number @The dot product between the two vectors
function Vector:Dot(otherVector)
end

--- @deprecated
--- @return Vector @Normalized version of the vector.
function Vector:GetNormal()
end

--- î®´ menu|client|server
--- Returns a normalized version of the vector. Normalized means vector with same direction but with length of 1.

--- ðŸ¦Ÿ **BUG**: [cam.Start3D or 3D context cam.Start with non-default parameters incorrectly sets the reference FOV for this function, causing incorrect return values.
