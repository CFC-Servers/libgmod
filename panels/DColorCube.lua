--- â„¹ **NOTE**: Calling this when using a color that isn't 100% saturated and valued (Global.HSVToColor with saturation and value set to 1) causes the color cube to look inaccurate compared to the color that's returned by methods like DColorCube:GetRGB and DColorCube:OnUserChanged. You should use DColorCube:SetColor instead
