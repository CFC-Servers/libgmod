--- A form which may be used to display text the player is meant to select and copy or alternately allow them to enter some text of their own.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: Do note that at least one of your `DTextEntry`'s parents must either be an EditablePanel or derived from it (like a DFrame, for example), else it won't be able to focus and thus be unselectable.  
--- You must also call Panel:MakePopup on said panel or the `DTextEntry` will not work.  
--- @class DTextEntry : TextEntry
local DTextEntry = {}
--- î®´ client
--- Called whenever the value of the panel has been updated (whether by user input or otherwise).  
--- It allows you to determine whether a user can modify the TextEntry's text.
