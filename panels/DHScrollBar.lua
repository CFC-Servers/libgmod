--- A generic horizontal scrollbar. See the vertical alternative [here](DVScrollBar).  
--- The scrollbar notably contains `DHScrollBar.btnLeft`, `DHScrollBar.btnRight`, and `DHScrollBar.btnGrip` which are the left button, right button, and grip respectively. Editing the paint functions of these allows custom scrollbar styling, although it is a better idea to use [Derma Skins](Derma_Skin_Creation).  
--- @class DHScrollBar : Panel
local DHScrollBar = {}
