--- **Lua reference description**: Returns `m` and `e` such that `x = m2e`, `e` is an integer and the absolute value of `m` is in the range ((0.5, 1) (or zero when x is zero).  
--- Used to split the number value into a normalized fraction and an exponent. Two values are returned: the first is a multiplier in the range `1/2` (**inclusive**) to `1` (**exclusive**) and the second is an integer exponent.

--- A variable that effectively represents infinity, in the sense that in any numerical comparison every number will be less than this.  
--- For example, if `x` is a number, `x > math.huge` will **NEVER** be `true` except in the case of overflow (see below).  
--- Lua will consider any number greater than or equal to `2^1024` (the exponent limit of a [double](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)) as `inf` and hence equal to this.
