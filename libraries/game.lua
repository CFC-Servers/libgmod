--- The game library provides functions to access various features in the game's engine, most of it's functions are related to controlling the map.  
_G.game = {}
--- Adds a new ammo type to the game.  
--- You can find a list of default ammo types here.  
--- âš  **WARNING**: This function must be called shared or you will have unexpected problems.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: This function must be called in GM:Initialize.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: There is a limit of 128 ammo types, including the default ones.  
--- @param ammoData table @The attributes of the ammo
function game.AddAmmoType(ammoData)
end

--- Registers a new decal.  
--- âš  **WARNING**: There's a rather low limit of around 256 for decal materials that may be registered and they are not cleared on map load.  
--- @param decalName string @The name of the decal.
--- @param materialName string @The material to be used for the decal
function game.AddDecal(decalName, materialName)
end

--- Loads a particle file.

--- @param particleFileName string @The path of the file to add
function game.AddParticles(particleFileName)
end

--- If called serverside it will remove ALL entities which were not created by the map(not players or weapons held by players).

function game.CleanUpMap(dontSendToClients, ExtraFilters)
end

--- Runs a console command.  
--- Make sure to add a newline ("\n") at the end of the command.  
--- âš  **WARNING**: If you use data that were received from a client, you should avoid using this function because newline and semicolon (at least) allow the client to run arbitrary commands!  
--- For safety, you are urged to prefer using Global.RunConsoleCommand in this case.  
--- @param stringCommand string @String containing the command and arguments to be ran.
function game.ConsoleCommand(stringCommand)
end

--- ðŸ¦Ÿ **BUG**: [Returns "0.0.0.0:`port`" on the server when called too early, including in GM:Initialize and GM:InitPostEntity. This bug seems to only happen the first time a server is launched, and will return the correct value after switching maps.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/3001)  
--- @return string @The IP address and port in the format "x.x.x.x:x"

function game.GetMapVersion()
end

--- Returns the difficulty level of the game.  
--- **TIP:** You can use this function in your scripted NPCs or Nextbots to make them harder, however, it is a good idea to lock powerful attacks behind the highest difficulty instead of just increasing the health.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: Internally this is tied to the gamerules entity, so you'll have to wait to wait until GM:InitPostEntity is called to return the skill level  
--- @return number @The difficulty level, Easy( 1 ), Normal( 2 ), Hard( 3 ).
function game.GetSkillLevel()
end

--- This will automatically change whenever the "skill" convar is modified serverside.

--- @param level number @The difficulty level, Easy( 1 ), Normal( 2 ), Hard( 3 ).
function game.SetSkillLevel(level)
end

--- Sets the time scale of the game.  
--- This function is supposed to remove the need of using the host_timescale convar, which is cheat protected.  
--- To slow down or speed up the movement of a specific player, use Player:SetLaggedMovementValue instead.  
--- â„¹ **NOTE**: Like host_timescale, this method does not affect sounds, if you wish to change that, look into GM:EntityEmitSound.
