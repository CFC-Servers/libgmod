--- î®´ client
--- Sets up a new 2D rendering context. Must be finished by cam.End3D2D. This function pushes a new matrix onto the stack. (cam.PushModelMatrix)  
--- Matrix formula:  
--- ```  
--- local m = Matrix()  
--- m:SetAngles(angles)  
--- m:SetTranslation(pos)  
--- m:SetScale(Vector(scale, -scale, 1))

--- âš  **WARNING**: This should be closed by cam.End3D2D otherwise the game crashes  
--- @param pos Vector @Origin of the 3D2D context, ie
--- @param angles Angle @Angles of the 3D2D context
--- @param scale number @The scale of the render context
