--- The engine library provides functions to access various features in the game's engine, most are related to the demo and save systems.  
_G.engine = {}
--- Returns the name of the currently running gamemode.  
--- @return string @The active gamemode's name
function engine.ActiveGamemode()
end

--- Closes the server and completely exits.  
--- This is only functional when running in server test mode (launch option -systemtest). Server test mode is used internally at Facepunch as part of the build process to make sure that the dedicated servers aren't crashing on startup.  
function engine.CloseServer()
end

--- Returns a list of addons the player have subscribed to on the workshop.  
--- This list will also include "Floating" .gma addons that are mounted by the game, but not the folder addons.  
--- @return table @A table with 6 keys (downloaded, models, title, file, mounted, wsid)
function engine.GetAddons()
end

--- When starting playing a demo, engine.GetDemoPlaybackTick will be reset and its old value will be added to this functions return value.  
--- @return number 
function engine.GetDemoPlaybackStartTick()
end

--- Current tick of currently loaded demo.  
--- If not playing a demo, it will return amount of ticks since last demo playback.  
--- @return number @The amount of ticks of currently loaded demo.
function engine.GetDemoPlaybackTick()
end

--- Returns time scale of demo playback.  
--- If not during demo playback, returns 1.  
--- @return number @The time scale of demo playback, value of demo_timescale console variable.
function engine.GetDemoPlaybackTimeScale()
end

--- Returns total amount of ticks of currently loaded demo.  
--- If not playing a demo, returns 0 or the value of last played demo.  
--- @return number @Total amount of ticks of currently loaded demo.
function engine.GetDemoPlaybackTotalTicks()
end

--- Returns a table containing info for all installed gamemodes  
--- @return table @gamemodes
function engine.GetGamemodes()
end

--- Returns an array of tables corresponding to all games from which Garry's Mod supports mounting content.  
--- @return table @A table of tables containing all mountable games
function engine.GetGames()
end

--- üõë **DEPRECATED**: Used internally for in-game menus, may be merged in the future into engine.GetAddons.  
--- Returns the UGC (demos, saves and dupes) the player have subscribed to on the workshop.  
--- @return table @Returns a table with 6 keys (title, type, tags, wsid, timeadded)
function engine.GetUserContent()
end

--- Returns true if we're currently playing a demo.  
--- You will notice that there's no server-side version of this. That's because there is no server when playing a demo. Demos are both recorded and played back purely clientside.  
--- @return boolean @Whether the game is currently playing a demo or not.
function engine.IsPlayingDemo()
end

--- Returns true if the game is currently recording a demo file (.dem) using gm_demo  
--- @return boolean @Whether the game is currently recording a demo or not.
function engine.IsRecordingDemo()
end

--- This is a direct binding to the function ‚Äúengine->LightStyle‚Äù. This function allows you to change the default light style of the map - so you can make lighting lighter or darker. You‚Äôll need to call render.RedownloadAllLightmaps clientside to refresh the lightmaps to this new color.  
--- ü¶ü **BUG**: [Calling this function with arguments 0 and "a" will cause dynamic lights such as those produced by the Light tool to stop working.](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/3626)  
--- @param lightstyle number @The lightstyle to edit
--- @param pattern string @The pattern to change the lightstyle to
function engine.LightStyle(lightstyle, pattern)
end

--- Loads a duplication from the local filesystem.  
--- @param dupeName string @Name of the file
--- @return string @Compressed dupeData
function engine.OpenDupe(dupeName)
end

--- Returns an estimate of the server's performance. Equivalent to calling Global.FrameTime from the server, according to source code.  
--- @return number, number
function engine.ServerFrameTime()
end

--- Returns the number of ticks since the game server started.  
--- @return number @Number of ticks since the game server started.
function engine.TickCount()
end

--- Returns the number of seconds between each gametick.

function engine.TickInterval()
end

--- Returns video recording settings set by video.Record. Used by Demo-To-Video feature.

function engine.VideoSettings()
end

--- Saves a duplication as a file.  
--- @param dupe string @Dupe table, encoded by util.TableToJSON and compressed by util.Compress
--- @param jpeg string @The dupe icon, created by render.Capture
function engine.WriteDupe(dupe, jpeg)
end

--- Stores savedata into the game (can be loaded using the LoadGame menu)  
--- @param saveData string @Data generated by gmsave.SaveMap
--- @param name string @Name the save will have.
--- @param time number @When the save was saved during the game (Put CurTime here)
--- @param map string @The map the save is used for.
function engine.WriteSave(saveData, name, time, map)
